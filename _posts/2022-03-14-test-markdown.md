**WORK IN PROGRESS**[^1]



I recently discovered [GitHub’s platform](https://pages.github.com/) but is not “new” at all. Researchers in Digital Humanities or out this academic field have been using this tool quite often since its appearance in 2007. GitHub is a collaborative code Internet hosting provider, in other words, is an online place where a website can be hosted and supported in the World Wide Web.Th is tool allows to do hosting of open-source projects, and because of this, it is a popular platform with more than 73 million developers and more than 200 million repositories. The largest code hosting site nowadays! 

To begin with, the platform is designed in a really simple way if we consider that this is a software for the creation and hosting of websites. Personally, I appreciated how provides for free an introduction to writing in Markdown, a standardized format for writing a plain text while encoding the structure for later representation in Word, PDF, or HTML. Moreover, GitHub has already an archive of a series of “themes” or designs that make easier not only the selection of a style but also having done the first configurative steps and elements to form a website or repository. Each component and step to follow is described inside the corpus or configuration part of the theme. Developers can create a copy of a repository and pull a request for pulling the changes into the main branch. As Tsay, Dabbish, and Herbsleb content “GitHub makes the relationships between users and work artifacts transparent. This transparency enables developers to better use information such as technical value and social connections when making work decisions” (“Influence of social and technical factors” 356). Thus, every step can be tracked, and a network of users - a social feature- along with the platform, made possible the option of sharing information, profiles, projects, and on. 

The social media embedded in GitHub makes possible, as well, open-source software whose design and conception promote not only the idea of transparency but also the confidence to developers. Codes are always visible, and users can check past projects, evaluate them and decide which one can be better to implement or improve as a contribution to the original proposal. Developers can “play” with the interface in practical ways like managing their projects, help to other users with their stuck points or needs, or even asking for other developers to join their team and project. Researchers like Tsay, Dabbish, and Herbsle call this new kind of developers with an active role in the contributions as newcomers. Indeed, these trainees working with open-source projects “might investigate what prior contribution attempts look like and how they have fared, as signals of openness and project norms. Studies on these kinds of transparent environments suggest that developers make complex inferences about other developers and projects using these kinds of information” (“Influence of social and technical factors” 356).

The possibility of transparency is one of the most awesome features that I found. GitHub hosted all its repositories publicly, which means that anyone with Internet access can consult the activity within projects and at the same time can take advantage of learning from it for any developer or researcher goal. The software publishes activities like actions, issues, pull requests, subscription information, commits, and even the comment accompanying the commit action! At the same time, there is a fantastic feature which is a dataset of the history of events in GitHub. Every developer can track the activity monitoring this timeline and even more, get specific events from other repositories. The latter become very interesting for me as a beginner, because it is a helpful feature for not getting lost, stressed, or frustrated with a particular phase. If by any chance you get trapped, you will have an explanation of the errors with the commit and a history of what you did, so you can go back to the last “correct” step.  You can work “forking” different branches of the same repository which permits check drafts or oldest versions of the current one. 

Therefore, there is a huge amount of public data available to assist newcomers and projects working asynchronously; any user can comment on a pull request and suggest improvements to the code change. The software in its social aspect facilitates “follow” members as a very well-mentioned community where every user can receive help, feedback, and use others' work as a sample or platform. The members of the community can “start” repositories of different projects and follow events like the creation of a new project. This action of starring a repository “works similarly to a bookmarking system, adding the starred project to a list of projects for a particular user. In addition, participants have a profile page that lists personal information as well as activity-related information such as the repositories they own and watch as well as the participants that they follow (“Let's talk about it” 359).

On the other hand, the technical part becomes the first issue when we are newcomers. For that reason, GitHub allows also make a copy of any public project, as I mentioned before. Users can make changes and alter functionalities always within the code of the original branch. This feature allowed me to “fork” the theme “Beautiful Jekyll” from the GitHub library of themes and start creating my version. I requested some code changes to the project’s main repository.
How do I do it?  First, I created a GitHub account, and I made my repository public. Then, it was part searching in Google how to use GitHub. There is a lot of online forums, websites, and social pages that help in every step, and I consider that this is because of the nature of GitHub as transparent and public project that promotes collaboration too. Later, I definitely explored the GitHub platform and my own code for the website making sure that my theme supports blogging to publish my posts. I “fork” my website in a master branch, discovered the “settings” and named the repository. In these primary steps, I learned that GitHub needs a format for naming, like “dionae91.github.io”, which means that I worked under a subdomain of “github.io”. 

The configurative part was to start editing and customizing the “_config.yml”  file within the GitHub interface. Every minimum change required “commit” with a message describing what you did. This is recorded in the history timeline and then is also available for other developers. Besides, I took advanced of the posts in the “Beautiful Jekyll” theme, and I published my work on it. I did this because I worked remotely which involves that all my website’s files were on GitHub’s server. In other words, I did not use any program on my computers like Markdown, NotePad, or GitHub Desktop version. However, I must confess that this is a risk because I did not have any local version or backup in case of any issue. But certainly, this is another feature to work with GitHub, the possibility to download for free a GitHub desktop version, use any markdown program able to save “.md” files, and finally clone the repository in a local computer to start pushing and committing the changes.  

After playing with GitHub, I discovered an awesome platform for digital humanists to store and share work. At the same time, it is a rich source of data on software development. I would say that because of the huge amount of users and projects, maybe some of them are inactive or with specific or personal content not relevant to a major audience. Kalliamvakou, Eirini, et al. argues that “GitHub is also being used for free storage and as a Web hosting service; and that almost 40% of all pull requests do not appear as merged, even though they were” (92). However, the enormous possibilities that this platform offers equally open a spectrum of purposes other than code hosting or collaborative development. The latter could be an issue if we consider some uses like free storage information and more, nevertheless, is not a critic instead of an open avenue to evaluate the capability and capacity of this free and collaborative platform as a hosting service.
